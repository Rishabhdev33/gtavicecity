# Game Controller using OpenCV (Just Paper) | Make Physical Therapy (Physiotherapy) Exciting 

# Short Intro
Playing games like `Need for Speed Most Wanted (NFS)` using `OpenCV (NO Keyboard required)`. `Paper` acts as a controller. (Works with any racing games and like GTA Vice City (tested)).

# How to use it:
Requirement: 3 Paper (Green, Yellow, Blue)
Install the Requirements: opencv
1)  Clone the repository
2)  Start the game (Racing Game)
3)  Execute nfs.py file

# Usecase:
1)  Making Physiotherapy exercise exciting like arm exercises, thumb movements (Thumb Extension and Flexion)
2)  Replacement of Kinect which can cost more than $200 (Rs. 14000+)
2)  Being active
3)  Controller is free of cost 

# Video Walkthrough:
0:00 Start of Video (purposely driven into the city to check the turning of the car (based on the angle))
1:30 Shows results at the end (not accurate now, need to work on that)
1:35 Pages used to control the game
1:38 2nd UI to just play games and no exercise

# Paper Use:
* `Green`: Forward and angle
* `Yellow`: #Nitrous
* `Blue`: Brakes and backwards

# Working:
OpenCV will detect the color through webcam, calculates the angle of rotation which is used for calculating the hand movements and direction of the car. 

# Special thanks to Aaron Callard and Hatem Abou-zeid, PhD for guidance to use OpenCV efficiently. Also, sentdex for tutorial on key press

# Please give feedback or suggestions to improve the experience. Thanks a lot :)
